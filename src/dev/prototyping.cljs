;; Calva dev instructions
; == You Control what is Evaluated ==
;; Please note that Calva never evaluates your code
;; unless you explicitly ask for it. So, except for
;; this file, you will have to load files you open
;; yourself. Make it a habit to do this, because
;; sometimes things don't work, and they fail in 
;; peculiar ways, when your file is not loaded.

;; Try it with this file: `Ctrl+Alt+C Enter`.
;; The result of loading a file is whatever is the
;; last top level form in the file.
